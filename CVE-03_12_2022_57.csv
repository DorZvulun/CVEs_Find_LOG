"CVE-2022-46167","Capsule is a multi-tenancy and policy-based framework for Kubernetes. Prior to version 0.1.3, a ServiceAccount deployed in a Tenant Namespace, when granted with `PATCH` capabilities on its own Namespace, is able to edit it and remove the Owner Reference, breaking the reconciliation of the Capsule Operator and removing all the enforcement like Pod Security annotations, Network Policies, Limit Range and Resource Quota items. An attacker could detach the Namespace from a Tenant that is forbidding starting privileged Pods using the Pod Security labels by removing the OwnerReference, removing the enforcement labels, and being able to start privileged containers that would be able to start a generic Kubernetes privilege escalation. Patches have been released for version 0.1.3. No known workarounds are available.","2022-12-02T19:15Z"
"CVE-2022-45933","KubeView through 0.1.31 allows attackers to obtain control of a Kubernetes cluster because api/scrape/kube-system does not require authentication, and retrieves certificate files that can be used for authentication as kube-admin. NOTE: the vendor's position is that KubeView was a ""fun side project and a learning exercise,"" and not ""very secure.""","2022-11-27T03:15Z"
"CVE-2022-41939","knative.dev/func is is a client library and CLI enabling the development and deployment of Kubernetes functions. Developers using a malicious or compromised third-party buildpack could expose their registry credentials or local docker socket to a malicious `lifecycle` container. This issues has been patched in PR #1442, and is part of release 1.8.1. This issue only affects users who are using function buildpacks from third-parties; pinning the builder image to a specific content-hash with a valid `lifecycle` image will also mitigate the attack.","2022-11-19T01:15Z"
"CVE-2022-45381","Jenkins Pipeline Utility Steps Plugin 2.13.1 and earlier does not restrict the set of enabled prefix interpolators and bundles versions of Apache Commons Configuration library that enable the 'file:' prefix interpolator by default, allowing attackers able to configure Pipelines to read arbitrary files from the Jenkins controller file system.","2022-11-15T20:15Z"
"CVE-2022-41235","Jenkins WildFly Deployer Plugin 1.0.2 and earlier implements functionality that allows agent processes to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system.","2022-09-21T16:15Z"
"CVE-2022-31030","containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in the containerd's CRI implementation where programs inside a container can cause the containerd daemon to consume memory without bound during invocation of the `ExecSync` API. This can cause containerd to consume all available memory on the computer, denying service to other legitimate workloads. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation; `ExecSync` may be used when running probes or when executing processes via an ""exec"" facility. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.6 and 1.5.13. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used.","2022-06-09T14:15Z"
"CVE-2022-27201","Jenkins Semantic Versioning Plugin 1.13 and earlier does not restrict execution of an controller/agent message to agents, and implements no limitations about the file path that can be parsed, allowing attackers able to control agent processes to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.","2022-03-15T17:15Z"
"CVE-2021-21693","When creating temporary files, agent-to-controller access to create those files is only checked after they've been created in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier.","2021-11-04T17:15Z"
"CVE-2017-2599","Jenkins before versions 2.44 and 2.32.2 is vulnerable to an insufficient permission check. This allows users with permissions to create new items (e.g. jobs) to overwrite existing items they don't have access to (SECURITY-321).","2018-04-11T16:29Z"
